Understand types of data, like tabular data, voctor data, and then you can stylize with stylize layers

Three legs of a GIS system are spatial analysis, digital certography, and database management systems

spatial data has an explicit linkage to geographic space. These are based on coordinate systems. Latitude and longitude are not the only coordinate systems.

Angle based system is different than flattened base system, most GIS systems used angle based systems.

DEM: digital elevation model
Raster data set.

We can co-register data sets in GIS data which is called a layer.  We're taking a real object and prepresenting it in a computer, we can do this in a couple ways.  We're not trying to make a mode of the real world, we're trying to simplify the data so we can see connections and abstractions.:

Vector data sets have: points (x,y,z coordinate locations), lines (points that are connected together) and polygons (lines that are connected together, also know as areas) and they live in discreet co-ordinate space.

Rasters are continuous surfaces of pixel cells where each cell contains data has a surface of pixels and you can process it faster, but the sheer size of the data set is significantly larger.

Are almost universally more appropriate to display elevation with raster data, but it's dumb to map data like the location of all the fire hydrants in a city because those are a collection of discrete objects rather than a continuous inspection of the.

Raster is faster, vector is more corrector

4 cartographic properties, space, area, distance, and direction (azimuth or the angles).  You always have distortion in 2 of these.  Mercador map preserved angle and direction

Raster is better for continuous data, and vector data is generally better for

Data format we're actually using is
